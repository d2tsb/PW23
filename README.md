## !!!Disclaimer!!!: Sourcecode only works if dependencies as 'ressources' are given. 
Please be welcomed to visit my [homepage](https://www.tilmanbertram.com).


### The Website features:
  + Lifeline:
    A better way to show a users history/lifepath.
  + GithubCrawler:
    Crawls a users Git(Hub) content/infos using the Github REST API,
    and displays it appropriatly, styled with CSS.
  
### About this Website
  Well the website and its core-elements were written in ReactJS.
  ReactJS is a Framework developed by Facebook to quickly 
  create Frontend Webapplications and uses NodeJS as its base,
  by involving HTML and CSS into the code. 
  This website is hosted with nginx.
  This website was built using yarn.

### Remarks and TODO
  This is one of my first websites - so includes features, that are outdated.
  This code maybe getting refactored, because the concepts aren't up-to-date.

  CSS -> SCSS with BEM (Block, Elements, Modifiers)
  Remove inline CSS-styling
  App.js is way to arbitrary. 
  Maybe fix the text bump, when switching between 'About and Preferences'
